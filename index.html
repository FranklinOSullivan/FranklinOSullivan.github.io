                    Built a calculator using HTML and CSS. This helped me to learn x and y . I used z to do this.

                <p>
                    Created an SR-Latch using passive components.
                    I was interested in this project due to how useful it is in computer memory and registers.
                    Understanding how memory is stored within a computer helped me to better understand how registers
                    are able to store their values.

                    Used an ATmega328p to write to a strip of Individually addressable LEDs. This project was able to
                    run off an IR input using ISR's.

                smoothly
