                    Built a calculator using HTML and CSS. This helped me to learn x and y . I used z to do this.

                    Created an SR-Latch using passive components.
                    I was interested in this project due to how useful it is in computer memory and registers.
                    Understanding how memory is stored within a computer helped me to better understand how registers
                    are able to store their values.

                    Used an ATmega328p to write to a strip of Individually addressable LEDs. This project was able to

<!-- Future projects:
Alarm clock made with ATmega328p. Have it connected to 3 buttons, min, hour, alarm. Displayed on 4 7seg displays.
Can be hung on a wall and dimmed at night.

Connect a pump to the newt tank to allow them some flowing water. Can be connected to all kinds of electronics.

A way to generate energy from rainfall.
