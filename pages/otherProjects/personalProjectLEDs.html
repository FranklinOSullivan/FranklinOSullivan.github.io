                    During the first lockdown in 2020, I wanted a project that I could work on endlessly, due to import
                    delays and the difficulty of sourcing components. I found that a strip of individually addressable
                    LEDs would be very entertaining and fun to work with as it was something I could set up in my room
                    and view/work on, daily. I also found that using an infared remote as an input was very easy to do
                    and allowed me to select multiple modes without the need of uploading new code each time.

                    This project was my first real introduction to the world or firmware development, before I even knew
                    what git was. Throughout this project I learned about how the arduino IDE works and how it is able
                    to connect to external inputs and outputs. This included writing to pins and doing so as part of a
                    loop. I discovered how to use inputs, like an infared remote. Sadly I did not know about interrupts
                    at the time and was not able to utilize them to the fullest of their ability, though I was able to
                    devise a method to break out of loops when given an input.

                    This project is quite old now and upon reviewing it, it has inspired me to remake the project.
                    Without the use of an arduino board but rather with an Atmega328p and a nicely assembled circuit. I
                    will be able to use interrupts for the infared remote, simplifying the circuit greatly. I will also
                    be able to learn how to properly write to the LEDs as instead of using an arduino library I will be
                    able to use their "single NZR communication mode".
