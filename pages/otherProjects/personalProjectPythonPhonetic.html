                    The purpose of making this simple game was to ensure I could still use python. The programme selects
                    a value randomly and tests to see if the user knows the expected result. If they were able to
                    guess correctly, they would gain a point. Else they would be told the answer and lose their streak.
                    The highest streak from a playing session was stored in a file, keeping track of the top 5 high
                    scores.

                <p>
                    Through this project, I learned how to use the random library in python, as well as reading and
                    writing to external files.

                    A future inspiration from this project would be to develop a game that is able to use self-made
                    flashcards instead of pairs of words. This could allow a user to learn anything in a fun and
                    interesting way. This would also include having a method to add or remove items from the file used
                    to test the user.
