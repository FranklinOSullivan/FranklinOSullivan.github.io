                    The purpose of making this simple game was to ensure that I could still use python. I would simply
                    select a value at random and test to see if the user knows the expected result. If they were able to
                    guess correcty, they would gain a point. Else they would be told the answer and lose their streak.
                    The highest streak from a playing session was stored to a file, keeping track of the top 5 high
                    scores.

                    Through this project I learned how to use the random library in python, as well as, reading and
                    writing to external files.

                    A future inspiration of this project would be to develop a method that is able to use flash cards.
                    This could allow for a user to learn anything in a fun and interesting way. This would also include
                    having a method to add or remove items from the file that is used to test them.
