                    Moving into the field of firmware, the STM32 is a very powerful board that many hobbyists use.
                    It also has an intuitive and easy-to-use IDE which makes this simpler.<br><br>
                    I made this project to learn how this IDE works and the best way to go about using
                    an STM microcontroller. I was able to develop a program that would act as a dice and illuminate
                    the relevant LED for each number rolled.<br><br>
                    I achieved this using one of the onboard timer counters (T/C). I set the T/C to
                    increment in time with the system clock, counting from 0 to a max value of 5. This
                    allowed for six different possible values of the T/C at any given time.<br><br>
                    With the random values ready, I simply had to read the current value of the T/C every time the user
                    pressed the onboard button and write this output to the LEDs depending on the values.

                    The first thing I learned very quickly was how important it is to read a datasheet fully before
                    purchasing a piece of hardware. This came to my attention as I was trying to implement a randomly
                    generated number (RNG)
                    in my code.<br><br>
                    Some STM32 boards come with an RNG register. This is a 32-bit register that is filled with
                    electrical noise, allowing for easy access to random numbers.<br>
                    The board that I got did not have one of these registers.<br><br>
                    Aside from that, I mostly just learned how the IDE of the STM32 works and became more comfortable
                    working with them and microcontrollers in general.

                    A future inspiration that I gained from this project was simply that I wanted to do more work with
                    the STM32 controllers in the future and, ideally do a more complex project that will allow me to
                    push the STM32 to its limits.
