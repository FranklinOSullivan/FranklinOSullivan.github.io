                    An SR-Latch is an integral part of computer memory. Two transisitors and a few baising resisitors
                    are able to store one bit of memory (a high or a low). I found that this was worth learning properly
                    as it is the foundation of how computer registers and memory works.<br><br>
                    I found that this project would also allow me to invest more time into learning about the hardware
                    side of the computer to better understand its functions and how to best utilize it in the future.

                    In order to plan and verify the design I was using for the SR-Latch. I first needed to create some
                    simulation files to test what the outcome of the circuit would be.<br><br>
                    I found that the best way to do this would be through the use of LTSpice, which is a spice based
                    simulation software we use in university projects.
                    Below is the file I used for my simulations.<br><br>
                    This helped to verify that in theory, my design was correct and that it would likely work as
                    expected. The next step was to assemble the circuit onto a breadboard, allowing for easy
                    modification where nessecary.
                    The results from this breadboarding can be seen below.<br><br>
                    At this point I knew that the design I had been working with was correct and that I would be able to
                    move forward to solder it together.
                    The final soldered board can be seen below.<br>
