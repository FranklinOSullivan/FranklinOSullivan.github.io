                    As a final year Computer Systems Engineering student at the University of Auckland, I am
                    passionately engaged in acquiring a diverse skill set that spans electronics, software engineering,
                    and computer architecture. I am inspired by the potential of embedded systems to revolutionize
                    industries through smart design and I am excited to pioneer this in my career journey.
                    <!-- Though it also teaches me many
                    electronics and software engineering skills, useful to know for computer systems and important to
                    understand for real-world applications. -->

                    gaining support from senior developers who can help me solve problems efficiently and in the correct
                    manner. It would also be a massive bonus if this position allowed me to return for subsequent
                    periods, allowing my skills to develop further in a familiar environment. -->

                        values of current, voltage and power. We then wrote these values to a 4-bit 7-segment display,
                        UART transmission to a computer and python application.
