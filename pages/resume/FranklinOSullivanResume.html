                    I am a third-year Computer Systems Engineering student at the University of Auckland. This degree
                    couples electronics and software engineering to teach an array of theoretical and practical skills
                    related largely to computer architecture and embedded systems. Though it also teaches me many
                    electronics and software engineering skills, useful to know for computer systems and important to
                    understand for real-world applications.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I plan to gain a position as an intern in which I will be able to do real work for a company while
                    gaining support from senior developers who can help me solve problems efficiently and in the correct
                    manner. It would also be a massive bonus if this position allowed me to return for subsequent
                    periods, allowing my skills to develop further in a familiar environment.

                        I created an SR-Latch (one-bit computer memory) using passive components.

                    <li>
                        I was interested in this project because of its usefulness in applications such as computer
                        memory and registers. It also helped me further develop my simulating, breadboarding and
                        soldering skills while teaching me about power usage and selecting optimal components.

                    <li>
                        I built a basic HTML calculator to verify and brush up on my Javascript skills. This project
                        then allowed me to make a more complex iteration of the same idea to work on multiple different
                        skills using both HTML and JavaScript.

                    <li>
                        A further iteration of this project led me to create a calculator that was based on finding
                        accurate resistor pairs for a wanted input value. The calculator would then display the accuracy
                        of both series and parallel resistor combinations so the user could select a favourite; based on
                        resistor series, resulting accuracy or simply values used.

                        Worked with a team to develop a smart energy monitor. By reading the voltage across and current
                        through a load using a shunt resistor, we could find and display the root mean square and peak
                        values of current, voltage and power. We then wrote these values to a 4-bit 7-segment display,
                        UART transmission to a computer and python application.

                        This internship allowed me to gain a familiarity with electrical systems in use within the
                        comsumer market. My tasks involved: connecting and verifying both mains lines up to 15Amps,
                        and peripherals/ interfaces, testing and troubleshooting of damaged electrical and electronic
                        systems or repairs of such systems.

                        children who wish to learn more. Through tutoring them, I am able to better grasp on software
                        concepts I have learned as I am able to describe them in a simpler and more effective way.
