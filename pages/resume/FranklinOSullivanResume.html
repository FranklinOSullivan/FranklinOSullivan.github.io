                    I am a Third-year Computer Systems Engineering student at the University of Auckland. I am very
                    passionate about electronics and software development, leading to my taking a degree in which I can
                    learn both. I am looking for an internship opportunity where I can learn one of these in much
                    greater detail, allowing me to utilize it to its full ability. I would ideally like a position where
                    I could return for subsequent years and even a full-time position upon graduation.

                        I created an SR-Latch (one-bit computer memory) using passive components.

                        I was interested in this project because of its usefulness in applications such as computer
                        memory and registers. It also helped me further develop my simulating, breadboarding and
                        soldering skills while teaching me about power usage and selecting optimal components.

                        Worked with a team to develop a smart energy monitor. By reading the voltage across and current
                        through a load using a shunt resistor, we could find and display the root mean square and peak
                        values of current, voltage and power. We then wrote these values to a 4-bit 7-segment display,
                        UART transmission to a computer and python application.

                        This position gives me a platform to share my knowledge of Software and Hardware with curious
                        children who wish to learn more. Through tutoring them, I am able to better grasp on software
                        concepts I have learned as I am able to describe them in a simpler and more effective way.

                        collectively have tasks completed by, or before their deadline. This taught me about people
                        management as well as organising time for a group of people.

                        This position allowed me to gain experience in a working environment. I had a very specific set
                        of jobs that were my responsibility to complete on time and without supervision so I learned how
                        to do them all to a high standard within the set time, without the requirement for someone to
                        guide me.
