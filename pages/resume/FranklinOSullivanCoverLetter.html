                    I am in my third year of a Bachelor of Engineering (Honors) degree, specialising in Computer Systems
                    Engineering at the University of Auckland.

                    Since a young age, I have had a great interest in software development and electronics design. These
                    were classes that I excelled in during high school and chose to pursue as extra-curricular
                    activities. Even now, I continue to learn skills and frameworks not taught within my degree, simply
                    for enjoyment and to see what I can achieve with them. I like to display some of these skills within
                    my projects.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Many of these projects can be seen on my personal website. Franklinosullivan.github.io

                    Computer Systems Engineering couples electronics and software engineering to teach an array of
                    theoretical and practical skills related largely to computer architecture and embedded systems.

                    Most notably, this includes teaching software development, including object-orientated programming,
                    and using many different data structures and algorithms to solve given problems quickly and
                    efficiently.

                    As well as electronics design, specifically: circuit design, simulation, breadboard testing, PCB
                    development and soldering. Along with this, there has been a focus on considerations such as power
                    used/ wasted, learning design tricks and reducing noise throughout PCBs and other circuits.

                    I want to work in a position where I can further develop my understanding of software and firmware
                    development. This is the part of the degree that I find the most enjoyable and have the majority of
                    my extra-curricular experience in.

                    I hope to gain a position as an intern where I can do research and development work for a company
                    while gaining support from senior developers who can show me how to solve problems efficiently and
                    correctly. It would also be a massive bonus if this position allowed me to return for subsequent
                    periods, allowing my skills to develop further in a familiar environment.
