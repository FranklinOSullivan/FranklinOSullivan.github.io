                <p id="introBio">
                    I am a third-year Computer Systems Engineering student at the University of Auckland. This degree
                    couples electronics and software engineering to teach an array of theoretical and practical skills
                    related largely to computer architecture and embedded systems.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I wish to work in a position where I am able to further develop my own understanding of these fields
                    as well as helping to improve my design skills. I would like to work for a company that gives me a
                    great deal of support and mentorship, where I will be able to grow and stay for many years.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Within my degree so far, I have gained experience in electronics design. This included circuit
                    design, simulation, breadboard testing, PCB development and soldering. It also led to many important
                    considerations such as power used/ wasted, access to instantaneous current from localised capacitors
                    and the reduction of noise through PCB layers.
                    <br />
                    I also have a strong background in software development which has beenm furthered with many
                    theoretical skills including object orientated programming and exposure and use of many different
                    data structures and algorithms.
                    <br />
                    My degree also has a very strong focus on teamwork and communication which is displayed in many of
                    my papers and projects.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Ideally, I would work in firmware or embedded systems development. This is the part of the degree
                    that I find the most enjoyable, and have the most experience in. The responsibility of working on
                    cyber-physical systems requiring real-time, safety-critical systems would also be a huge bonus.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Due to the location of my studies I have a very strong background in english with superb
                    communication skills both verbally and written.
