                    I am a Third-year Computer Systems Engineering student at the University of Auckland. I am very
                    passionate about electronics and software development, leading to my taking a degree in which I can
                    learn both. I am looking for an internship opportunity where I can learn one of these in much
                    greater detail, allowing me to utilize it to its full ability. I would ideally like a position where
                    I could return for subsequent years and even a full-time position upon graduation.
                    <br />
