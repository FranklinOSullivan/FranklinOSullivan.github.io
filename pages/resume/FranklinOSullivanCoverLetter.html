                    I am in my third year of a Bachelor of Engineering (Honors) degree, specialising in Computer systems
                    Engineering.

                    Since a young age, I have had a great interest in software development and electronics design. These
                    were classes that I excelled in during high school and chose to pursue as extra cirricular
                    activities aswell. This interest has allowed me to learn many of the useful skills required and to
                    use them in my own personal projects outside of school or university.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Many of these projects can be seen on my personal website.

                    The Computer Systems Engineering degree couples electronics and software engineering to teach an
                    array of theoretical and practical skills related largely to computer architecture and embedded
                    systems.

                    Most notably, this includes the teaching of theoretical software development, including
                    object orientated programming, as well as the use of many different data structures and
                    algorithms to solve given problems quickly and efficiently.

                    There is also an emphasis on understanding basic electronics design. Specifically circuit design,
                    simulation, breadboard testing, PCB development and soldering. Along with this, there has been a
                    focus on considerations such as power used/ wasted, design tricks like allowing easy access to
                    instantaneous current from localised capacitors and the reduction of noise throughout PCB layers.

                    I would like to work in a position where I am able to further develop my understanding of these
                    fields as well as helping to improve my skills. I would love to work in firmware or embedded
                    systems
                    development. This is the part of the degree that I find the most enjoyable and have the most
                    experience in. The responsibility of working on cyber-physical systems requiring real-time,
                    safety-critical systems would also be a massive bonus as it would teach me many industry skills
                    that are not quickly learned in university or through research.

                    I plan to gain a position as an intern in which I will be able to do real work for a company
                    while
                    gaining support from senior developers who can help me solve problems efficiently and in the
                    correct
                    manner. It would also be a massive bonus if this position allowed me to return for subsequent
                    periods, allowing my skills to develop further in a familiar environment.
