                <p id="introBio">
                    I am a third-year Computer Systems Engineering student at the University of Auckland.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This degree couples electronics and software engineering to teach an array of theoretical and
                    practical skills related largely to computer architecture and embedded systems.

                    Most noably this includes the teaching of theoretical software development including object
                    orientated programming as well as use of many different data structures and
                    algorithms to solve given problems quickly and effeciently.

                    There is also emphasis on electronics design. Specifically, circuit design, simulation, breadboard
                    testing, PCB development and soldering. Due to this, there has been a focus on considerations such
                    as power used/ wasted, tricks like access to instantaneous current from localised capacitors and the
                    reduction of noise throughout PCB layers.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Learning all of this has allowed me to pursure computer systems design for fun in my own time.
                    Leading to the development of many of my own projects accross all three diciplines of electronics,
                    computer systems and software.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I wish to work in a position where I am able to further develop my understanding of these fields
                    as well as helping to improve my skills. I would love to work in firmware or embedded systems
                    development. This is the part of the degree that I find the most enjoyable, and have the most
                    experience in. The responsibility of working on cyber-physical systems requiring real-time,
                    safety-critical systems would also be a huge bonus as it would teach me many industry skills that
                    are not easily learned in university or through research.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I hope to gain a position as an intern in which I will be able to do real work for a company, while
                    gaining support from senior developers who can help me solve problems effeciently and in the correct
                    manner. It would also be a huge bonus if this position allowed me to return for subsequent periods,
                    allowing my skills to develop further in a familiar environment.s
