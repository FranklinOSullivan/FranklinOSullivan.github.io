                    I am in my third year of a Bachelor of Engineering (Honors) degree, specialising in Computer systems
                    Engineering.

                    Since a young age, I have had a great interest in software development and electronics design. These
                    were classes that I excelled in during high school and chose to pursue as extracurricular
                    activities. This interest has allowed me to learn many valuable skills required and
                    use them in my projects outside of school or university.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Many of these projects can be seen on my personal website.

                    The Computer Systems Engineering degree couples electronics and software engineering to teach an
                    array of theoretical and practical skills related largely to computer architecture and embedded
                    systems.

                    Most notably, this includes teaching theoretical software development, including object-orientated
                    programming, and using many different data structures and algorithms to solve given problems quickly
                    and efficiently.

                    There is also an emphasis on understanding basic electronics design, specifically circuit design,
                    simulation, breadboard testing, PCB development and soldering. Along with this, there has been a
                    focus on considerations such as power used/ wasted, design tricks like allowing easy access to
                    instantaneous current from localised capacitors and reducing noise throughout PCB layers.

                    I want to work in a position where I can further develop my understanding of these fields and
                    improve my skills within them. I would love to work in firmware or embedded systems development.
                    This is the part of the degree that I find the most enjoyable and have the most experience in. The
                    responsibility of working on cyber-physical systems requiring real-time, safety-critical systems
                    would also be a massive bonus as it would teach me many industry skills that take time to learn in
                    university or through research.


                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I plan to gain a position as an intern where I can do real work for a company while gaining support
                    from senior developers who can help me solve problems efficiently and correctly. It would also be a
                    massive bonus if this position allowed me to return for subsequent periods, allowing my skills to
                    develop further in a familiar environment.
