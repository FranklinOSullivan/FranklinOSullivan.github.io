                    I am in my third year of a Bachelor of Engineering (Honors), specialising in Computer systems
                    Engineering.
                    This degree couples electronics and software engineering to teach an array of theoretical
                    and
                    practical skills related largely to computer architecture and embedded systems.

                    Most notably, this includes the teaching of theoretical software development, including
                    object
                    orientated programming, as well as the use of many different data structures and
                    algorithms to solve given problems quickly and efficiently.

                    There is also an emphasis on electronics design. Specifically circuit design, simulation,
                    breadboard
                    testing, PCB development and soldering. Due to this, there has been a focus on
                    considerations such
                    as power used/ wasted, tricks like access to instantaneous current from localised capacitors
                    and the
                    reduction of noise throughout PCB layers.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Learning all of this has allowed me to pursue computer systems design for fun in my own
                    time.
                    Leading to the development of many of my own projects across all three disciplines of
                    electronics,
                    computer systems and software.

                    I would like to work in a position where I am able to further develop my understanding of these
                    fields as well as helping to improve my skills. I would love to work in firmware or embedded
                    systems
                    development. This is the part of the degree that I find the most enjoyable and have the most
                    experience in. The responsibility of working on cyber-physical systems requiring real-time,
                    safety-critical systems would also be a massive bonus as it would teach me many industry skills
                    that are not quickly learned in university or through research.


                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I plan to gain a position as an intern in which I will be able to do real work for a company
                    while
                    gaining support from senior developers who can help me solve problems efficiently and in the
                    correct
                    manner. It would also be a massive bonus if this position allowed me to return for subsequent
                    periods, allowing my skills to develop further in a familiar environment.

                    Since the age of 12 I have been attending coding lessons with family friends. Since the age of 13 I
                    have been learning electronics theory and design with my school. I have always had a great interest
                    in these topics and found them very enjoyable. My passion also extends past a purely academic
                    venture. I have been making electronics and programming projects on my own time for many years
                    aswell. Although many of these were not overly complex to being with, I am now learning better and
                    beginning to make much more intricate and useful projects. (Many of these are displayed on my
                    website).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Having just completed my second year of university, I am in a position in which I know and
                    understand the basics of the field and am able to start using the skills I have learned to specify
                    myself more and gain a solid base for a field of work.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I am able to learn quick. I love to learn and want to know everything. I have a special interest in
