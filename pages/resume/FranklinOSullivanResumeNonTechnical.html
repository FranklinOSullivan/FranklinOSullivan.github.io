                    I am a Third-year Computer Systems Engineering student at the University of Auckland. I am
                    technically minded so I am able to focus for long periods of time and ensure that the work I am
                    doing is always correct and accurate. Along with this, I have great communication skills and am
                    great working with people and in a team.

                        This position gives me a platform to share my knowledge of Software and Hardware with curious
                        children who wish to learn more. Through tutoring them, I am able to better grasp on software
                        concepts I have learned as I am able to describe them in a simpler and more effective way.

                    <li>
                        This position allowed me to guide other employees to use their time efficiently so that we could
                        collectively have tasks completed by, or before their deadline. This taught me about people
                        management as well as organising time for a group of people.

                    <li>
                        This position allowed me to gain experience in a working environment. I had a very specific set
                        of jobs that were my responsibility to complete on time and without supervision so I learned how
                        to do them all to a high standard within the set time, without the requirement for someone to
                        guide me.
