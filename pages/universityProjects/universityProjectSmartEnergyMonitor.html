                    This project was led by my Electeng/Compsys 209 course at the University of Auckland. In teams of 4,
                    we were tasked with reading the voltage across and current through a variable load that we were
                    supplied.<br><br>
                    We were able to read the voltage across the load by simply devising a voltage divider in which we
                    would get a consistent ratio of the voltage across the load but would be able to work with a max
                    voltage of 5V, rather than a max of 20V.<br><br>
                    We were able to read the current through the load by using a shunt resistor. Due to OHM's law, we
                    knew that we could find the current through a resistor by simply taking the voltage across the
                    resistor and dividing this value by the resistance.<br>
                    We selected a resistor value small enough that we would not change the value of the readings
                    significantly, while also being large enough to supply us with a signal to noise ratio, SNR, that
                    would allow for accurate calculations. <br><br>
                    With both of these readings, we simply had to put them through an amplification stage, allowing for
                    a maximum value of 5V and a minimum of 0V, with a 2.5V offset. This was to ensure that we could read
                    the entire waveform with the microcontroller and not overload the pins.<br><br>
                    After amplification, it was important to filter the readings. This was achieved with second order
                    low pass Sallenkey filters, allowing for a 40dB drop per decade.<br><br>
                    For our design we also opted to use two zero crossing triggers, though we found that in case of
                    noise we would use Schmitt triggers, allowing for a small reigion of histeresis and preventing false
                    triggers.<br><br>
                    Once all of these readings had been taken by the microcontroller, we simply had to find what the
                    actual values of our readings would be and display these to our output pereferials. This included
                    writing to UART and a common cathod 4 bit 7 segment display.
