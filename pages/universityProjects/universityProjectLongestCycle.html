                    The purpose of this project was to be able to find the longest possible connected cycle in a
                    directed graph. This allowed me to use my graph traveral knowledge to find the longest possible
                    cycle in the graph from a given starting node.

                <p>
                    Through this project I learned why it can be important to know where the longest or shortest path in
                    a graph is and how to find this best.
