                    The purpose of this project was to understand what stronly connected components were and to be able
                    to find the quantity of strongly connected components in a graph.

                    Through this project I learned how to best traverse a graph in order to find the number of connected
                    components. This also required me to to learn how to reverse a directed graph, allowing me to use
                    the underlying graph.
