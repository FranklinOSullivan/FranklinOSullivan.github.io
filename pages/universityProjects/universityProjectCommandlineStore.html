                    Made a command line store in Java, which was able to store a large order, calculate combo prices and
                    apply discounts due to the number of items purchased. This project helped me to further my
                    object-orientated programming (OOP) skills and allowed me to do so in a simple and intuitive way.

                        <span id="firstLetter">W</span>hat did I learn?
                    </strong>
                </legend>
                <p>
                    Although I did not learn a great deal from this project, it did allow me to better my understanding
                    of how OOP is used and why it is useful for certain applications.

                    This project could easily be remade in a different language, allowing for a much nicer user
                    interface. I made a similar project years ago in HTML, which could easily be improved to match
                    the complexity level of this store.
