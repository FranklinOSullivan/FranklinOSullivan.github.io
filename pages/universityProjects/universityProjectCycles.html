                    This project was an assignment for a data structures and algorithms paper, though it comes with
                    great use. Throughout the paper, we learned about many algorithms, and many of them were only
                    able to run on acyclic graphs. This would require us to know whether the graph contains a cycle or
                    not. This project allows us to do this checking in a simple and quick way, allowing for the correct
                    selection of algorithm.

                    I learned how important it is to know whether or not a graph contains a cycle. This was paired
                    with the knowledge of what a cycle is and what it means when we find a cycle.

                    Sadly this project gave me no future inspiration.
