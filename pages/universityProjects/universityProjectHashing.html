                    This project was originally a project for a data structure and algorithms paper I took at
                    university. I found that this was a very useful concept and wanted to ensure that I understood it
                    fully and knew what the applications were to the real world.

                </legend>
                <p>
                    Throughout this project I learned about how important hashing is to the surivival of the internet. I
                    also learned about the different types of hashing and how these can be applicible to different
                    situations.

                </legend>
                <p>
                    Although there was not much future inspiration from this project, I found that it would be important
                    for me to learn how these concepts work on a data set that isn't just number in a test files. Due to
                    that when I find an application for hashing data I will ensure to go back to this project and
                    improve it.
