                    This was originally a project for a data structure and algorithms paper I took at
                    university. I found this was an instrumental concept and wanted to ensure that I understood it
                    fully and knew what the applications were to the real world.

                        <span id="firstLetter">W</span>hat did I learn?
                    </strong>
                </legend>
                <p>
                    Throughout this project, I learned how important hashing is to the survival of the internet. I
                    also learned about the different types of hashing and how these can be applicable to different
                    situations.

                </legend>
                <p>
                    Although there was not much future inspiration from this project, I found that it would be essential
                    for me to learn how these concepts work on a data set that isn't just numbers in a test file. Due to
                    that when I find an application for hashing data, I will ensure to go back to this project and
                    improve it.
