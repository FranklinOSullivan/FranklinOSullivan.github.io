                    An SR-Latch is an integral part of computer memory. Two transisitors and a few baising resisitors
                    are able to store one bit of memory (a high or a low). I found that this was worth learning properly
                    as it is the foundation of how computer registers and memory works.<br><br>
                    I found that this project would also allow me to invest more time into learning about the hardware
                    side of the computer to better understand its functions and how to best utilize it in the future.

                    In order to plan and verify the design I was using for the SR-Latch. I first needed to create some
                    simulation files to test what the outcome of the circuit would be.<br><br>
                    I found that the best way to do this would be through the use of LTSpice, which is a spice based
                    simulation software we use in university projects.

                    This helped to verify that in theory, my design was correct and that it would likely work as
                    expected. The next step was to assemble the circuit onto a breadboard, allowing for easy
                    modification where nessecary.

                At this point I knew that the design I had been working with was correct and that I would be able to
                move forward to solder it together, as shown in the initial image.<br>

                    Throughout this project I learned about how transistors are used as computer memory and what it
                    means when people say computers contain trillions of transistors.<br><br>
                    I also learned about how important it can be to select the correct components for a given job.
                    Although I was designing a small circuit that would simply turn on two LED's, it is always important
                    to consider the lifetime and use of the circuit. I found that it would have been more important for
                    me to consider the fact that this project is run off of a battery and that perhaps more care should
                    have been put into selecting the resistor values or even the type of transistors used.

                    Moving past this project, I would like to take the things I have leanred (thoough this project and
                    my university electronics paper), to design an adder circuit. This will be useful for me as it
                    contains many logic gates, which are essential to understand for computer operation. Furthermore it
                    will allow me to gain a better grasp on how computers are able to add large numbers and why it can
                    often take multiple clock cycles to do so.
