                    The purpose of this project was to ensure that I was still able to perform simple Javascript
                    calculations and function calls. Throughout a few iterations of my calculator this became better and
                    much more second nature again.

                    I decided that I would begin by developing a very simple calculator to ensure that I was using
                    Javascript correctly before switching to something more difficult.<br><br>
                    This first iteration of my calculator was very simple and involved only a few input boxes and
                    buttons. This calculator was able to do the most simple math and not much more.
