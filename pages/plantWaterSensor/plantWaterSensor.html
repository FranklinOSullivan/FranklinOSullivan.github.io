                    Life is precious. Plants can be espically so as they are able to generate food or other consumable
                    products. All plants require a different level of care. This can be anything from full sunlight all
                    days of the year as is experrienced by desert plants or it could be minimal sunlight with almost no
                    heat allowed, as is often seen in indoor house plants. <br />
                    <br />
                    In my room. I have a few plants that I care for, mostly for look. My most precious of these is my
                    Adanson's monstera (Monstera Adansonii). This plant comes from the rainforest reigions of Southern
                    and Central America. This means that the plant often requires a great amount of care, as it now
                    lives in a bedroom in New Zealand.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    My Adanson's monstera enjoys being difficult. It likes to live in a spot which experiences bright,
                    indirect sunlight, such as a windowsill. It lives best in a temperature range of 18 - 27 Degrees
                    Celcius, with an almost constant humidity level of 60%. This is exptremely difficult to maintain,
                    not only with temperatures in New Zealand bearly fitting the ideal ranges, but also because I have
                    no idea what is going on in the soil or how the plant is feeling on any given day.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I found that the best way to start caring for this plant better would be to start monitoring the
                    soil moisutre content. I achieved this through the use of an HW-080 soil moisture sensor.
                    <br />
                    I found that if I were to connect the sensor as a variable resistance in a voltage divider with a
                    10K Ohm resistor, I would be able to see the change in voltage being used by the moisture sensor,
                    and therefore determine the moisture content of the soil.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I took ADC readings from the soil every minute. This was because I found that the moisture content
                    took around 10 days to go from 100% humidity to 0% humidity, and 14400 updates would be pleanty.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I chose to take these readings with an STM32 microcontroller as I found that it would be be a great
                    chance for me to learn about the STM32 better and to deepen my understanding of firmware development
                    in general.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Once the data had been read onto the STM32 microcontroller, I found that I would need to display
                    this data in some way to the user, myself. The easiest and clearest way to achieve this would be
                    through the use of a 7-segment display. When testing if mine still worked, I managed to break it.
                    This meant that I would need to use a different approach. I instead opted to use an I2C Liquid
                    Crystal Display (LCD). This would force me to learn how the I2C protocol works and would allow for a
                    much nicer looking project.

                    Thoughout this project I learned many valuable skills. Most importantly was that I learned how to
                    use the I2C protocol. This will greatly increase the scope of projects that I can complete in the
                    future while also allowing me a deeper understanding of the world of electronics around me. Another
                    major learning point for me was that my stuides are paying off and that the choice to use a voltage
                    divider worked very well in describing the humidity of remaining in the soil.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    A fact that I learned is that caring for plants is not an exact science and that there is variation
                    in the needs of a plant due to many, many factors. While trying to keep the humidity at 60% was a
                    good idea and would likely have worked in ideal circumstances, I rather needed to keep an average of
                    60%. This meant allowing the plant time for its roots to dry between waterings, preventing root rot
                    and other forms of sickness.

                    This project was good fun as it allowed me not only to care for something that I was passionate
                    about, but it also gave me the chance to expand my electronics and firmware skills into the real
                    world, making a positive difference.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I find that some of the skills that I have gained may be useful in the agriculture and horticulture
                    industries, which are very prominent in New Zealand. I also find that my newly developed firmware
                    skills of using I2C will give me a chance to take on a greater range of projects in the future.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In terms of developing this project further. I hope that in the future I will be able to monitor
                    more factors that influence the plant. This will give me a better understanding of what it needs to
                    survive and how these should be best balanced. There may also be an opportunity to train an AI,
                    which will be able to care for this plant better than a human might be able to.
