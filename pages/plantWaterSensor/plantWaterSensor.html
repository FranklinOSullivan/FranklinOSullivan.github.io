                    Life is precious. Not only does Earth hold the only known instances of it, but it is also
                    required to feed and care for human beings. Throughout the world, there are millions of different
                    plant species, all with difference appearances, properties and needs.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In my room, I have a few plants that I care for, though largely for looks and not for food or
                    health. My most precious of these is my Adanson's monstera (Monstera Adansonii) which I rescued and
                    have raised since it was only a single leaf. This plant originates from the river valleys of South
                    and Central America. Meaning that it often requires a great amount of care, as it now
                    lives in a dry bedroom in New Zealand.

                <p>
                    The Adanson's monstera likes to live in a position in which it is able to experience bright,
                    indirect sunlight, such as a windowsill. It lives best in a temperature range of 18 - 27 Degrees
                    Celcius, with an ideal humidity level of 60%. This is extremely difficult to maintain,
                    not only with temperatures in New Zealand bearly fitting the ideal ranges, but also because I have
                    no idea what is going on in the soil in terms of humidity or how the plant is feeling on any given
                    day.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I found that the best way to start caring for this plant better would be to start monitoring the
                    soil moisutre content. I achieved this through the use of an HW-080 soil moisture sensor.
                    I found that if I were to connect the sensor as a variable resistance in a voltage divider with a
                    10K Ohm resistor, I would be able to see the change in voltage being used by the moisture sensor,
                    and therefore determine the moisture content of the soil.
                </p>
                <img src="../plantWaterSensor/images/soilMoistureSensor.jpg" alt="The HW-080 Soil moisture sensor"
                    style="height:200px;margin-top:15px;">
                <p class="figureDefinition">Figure 3: The HW-080 Soil moisture sensor</p>
                <p>
                    This worked well so I decided I would start taking ADC readings from the soil humidity sensor every
                    minute. With the moisture level in the soil taking around 5 days to reach 0%, I found that this
                    frequency of readings would be ideal for my use case.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I chose to take these readings with an STM32 microcontroller as I found that it would be be a great
                    chance for me to learn about the STM32 better and to deepen my understanding of firmware development
                    in general.

                <p class="figureDefinition">Figure 4: STM32 development board</p>
                <p>
                    Once the data had been read by the STM32 microcontroller, I found that I would need to display
                    this data in some way to the user, in this case that was myself. The easiest and clearest way to
                    achieve this would be through the use of a 7-segment display.
                    <br />
                    When testing if mine still worked, I managed to break it, forgetting to add a resistor to limit the
                    current. This meant that I would need to use a different approach. I instead opted to use an I2C
                    Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). This would force me to learn how the I2C protocol works and would
                    allow for a much nicer looking project.

                <p>
                    Thoughout this project I learned many valuable skills. Most importantly was that I learned how to
                    use the I2C protocol. This will greatly increase the scope of projects that I can complete in the
                    future while also allowing me a deeper understanding of the world of electronics around me. Another
                    major learning point for me was that my stuides are paying off and that the choice to use a voltage
                    divider worked very well in describing the humidity remaining in the soil.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    A further fact that I learned is that caring for plants is not an exact science and that there is
                    variation in the needs of a plant due to many, many factors. While trying to keep the humidity at
                    60% was a good idea and would likely have worked in ideal circumstances, I rather needed to keep an
                    average of 60%. This meant allowing the plant time for its roots to dry between waterings,
                    preventing root rot and other forms of sickness.

                    This project was good fun as it allowed me not only to care for something that I was passionate
                    about, but it also gave me the chance to expand my electronics and firmware skills into the real
                    world, making a positive difference.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I find that some of the skills that I have gained may be useful in the agriculture and horticulture
                    industries, which are very prominent in New Zealand. I also find that my newly developed firmware
                    skills of using the I2C protocol will give me a chance to take on a greater range of projects in the
                    future.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In terms of developing this project further. I hope that in the future I will be able to monitor
                    more factors that influence the plant. This will give me a better understanding of what it needs to
                    survive and how these should be best balanced. There may also be an opportunity to train an AI,
                    which will be able to care for this plant better than a human might be able to.
