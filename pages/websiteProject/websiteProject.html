                    The purpose of this project was practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. I wanted to find a way in
                    which I could display my all-rounded skills to people who were interested in seeing them. I found
                    that a website was the best way to do this as people could access it themselves easily from anywhere
                    in the world.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I also saw this as a chance to gain some new skills for software development, this included trying
                    new frameworks and methods of development.

                    During the development of this site I learned a lot. Initially I did not know how best to present
                    the page. I toyed with many different colour and display styles, before landing on the current
                    model. I then had to find a simple way to host the page, ideally for free as the page would incur
                    minimal traffic and therefore would not need to be set up for high traffic use. Hosting through
                    github was even simpler than I thought. The next hurdle was selecting a method to code
                    the page. I trialled and tested with a few different frameworks, NodeJs and NextJS. Both of these
                    taught me how to use react, though I found that they were a bit difficult and unnessecary for what I
                    wanted to achieve.
                    Eventually I decided I would simply use HTML by itself. A few times I have tried to implement react,
                    though I do not see the value in it when I do not require anything difficult that cannot be achieved
                    by HTML.

                <p>
                    Future inspiration for this website is continue filling it with projects. Ideally I will be able to
                    move to NextJs at some point in the future. This would also allow for simple database integration,
                    allowing projects to be added easier and not just being typed into HTML files. I also
                    wish for the website to become more interactive and enjoyable to use. This could include expanding
                    images on hover or displaying project
                    cards in a more captivating manner. I also find it will be important to include many more photos and
                    code snippets for the future as this will allow me to display my projects much clearer.
