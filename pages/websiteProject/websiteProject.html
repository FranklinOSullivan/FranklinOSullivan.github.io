                    The purpose of this project was practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. I wanted to find a way in
                    which I could display my all-rounded skills to people who were interested in seeing them. I found
                    that a website was the best way to do this as people could access it themselves easily from anywhere
                    in the world.

                    During the development of this site I learned a lot. Initially I did not know how best to present
                    the page. I toyed with many different colour and display styles, before landing on the current
                    model. I then had to find a simple way to host the page, ideally for free as it would incur minimal
                    traffic. Hosting through github was even simpler than I thought it could be and was a great way to
                    incentivise me to active use github for everything. The next hurdle was selecting a method to code
                    the page. I trialled and tested with a few different frameworks, NodeJs and NextJS. Both of these
                    taught me how to use react, though I found that they were a bit difficult and unnessecary.
                    Eventually I decided I would simply use HTML by itself. A few times I have tried to implement react,
                    though I do not see the value in it when I do not require anything difficult that cannot be achieved
                    by HTML.

                    Future inspiration for this website is continue filling it with projects. Ideally I will be able to
                    move to NextJs at some point in the future. This would also allow for simple database integration,
                    allowing projects to be added much simpler and not just being HTML files filled with text. I also
                    wish for the website to become more interactive and enjoyable to use.

                    Other things I wish to add include expanding images on hover, or at least reacting to it. Project
                    cards looking better and reacting on hover as well.
